🎉 Thrilled to share that I’ve been awarded a Starting Grant from the [Fondo Italiano per la Scienza](https://shorturl.at/stHDX) ("Italian ERC"), sponsored by the Italian Ministry of Research. 


My five-year project, NARNIA – “NAture-related systemic Risks: micro exposures, macro-financial policies for a Network-based Integrated Assessment” – tackles a critical gap in how we understand and respond to environmental degradation.

The project will develop an empirically-grounded integrated macro-financial framework that quantifies how nature-related risks percolate through economic and financial networks, creating systemic vulnerabilities.

By linking evironmental degradation to economic and financial instability, the project will provide the evidence base needed to design frameworks that ensure both economic stability and ecosystem resilience

This achievement would not have been possible without:
💡 The intellectually stimulating environment at the Institute of Economics of [Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna](https://www.santannapisa.it/it)
📚 The collaborations with colleagues and the growing research community exploring the intersections of macroeconomics, complexity science, and the environment.

Look forward on the journey ahead!!
