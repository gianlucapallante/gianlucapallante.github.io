🌍 Great to be at EAEPE – European Association for Evolutionary Political Economy Conference, co-organizing the special session “Alternative Paradigms For Climate Macroeconomics: From Empirics To Modeling” 🚨

The session brought together cutting-edge approaches to climate macroeconomics, featuring agent-based models, integrated assessment frameworks, and innovative computational methods for understanding climate-induced financial risks. 📈

I presented work in progress on “Navigating Climate-Induced Systemic Risk: Insights from an Agent-based Integrated Assessment Model,” contributing to rich discussions on the intersection of climate dynamics, systemic risk, and macroeconomic modeling. 💡

Exciting developments ahead: follow-up workshop planned at Scuola Superiore Sant’Anna on the same topics—stay tuned for more! 🔜
