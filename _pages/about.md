I am post-doctoral research fellow at the Institute of Economics of Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies (Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna) of Pisa.

I am a macroeconomist, interested in the analysis of technical change and the transformative role of industrial and innovation policies — such as those aimed at triggering a just and orderly green transition.

I use agent-based modeling techniques to analyze the complex interplay technological progress, economic change and financial stability. I also explore methodological aspects for improving the validity and the reliability of agent-based models to provide realistic representation of economic dynamics and robust integrated scenarios.
